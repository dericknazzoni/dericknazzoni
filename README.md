# Projects i have worked on:
## PicPay 
I haved been working for PicPay for the past 2 years, helping them implemente new features to impprove the user journey for the credit card product. I will be showcasing two features i implemented. 

### 🐷Piggybank
With the piggybank feature we wanted to help the client have more credit for his card. So the solution was to create a piggybank that he could use to save money and every penny he saved would be converted to credit for his card.

### 💵Timeline
As the name says basically we created a timeline so that the user can be able to see his purchases, showing him a icon of the type of purchase the date, time and value.

## Bank Next
While working with Next i helped developing a FAQ scene, a screen with the poupose of speeding up the time it takes for the user to call the customer service center and ask questions. The screen speeds up this process as he may end up finding possible doubts he may have inside the app.

# 🧔🏻Personal Project - Weather App
A simple Weather App built with Swift that utilizes the OpenWeatherAPI to provide real-time weather information. The app features an autocomplete search field with location suggestions and allows users to choose between Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature display.
